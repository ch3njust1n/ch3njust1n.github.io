The panelists will dissect and discuss the plausibility of artificial intelligence technologies from specific anime such as Ghost in the Shell, Ergo Proxy, and other anime. To wrap things up, there will be a live demonstration of Beating the World's Best at Super Smash Bros. with Deep Reinforcement Learning paper and real-time Neural Style Transfer.",
